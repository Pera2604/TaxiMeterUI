Project Name: TaxiMeter UI

Due to: 29th of March

Graphical system: (First: ) WPF & (Second: ) .netmaui

Logic:
	Date Time - Displayed at all times, shows real time Date: D:M:Y, Time: H:M:S
	Tariff (Top right) - Displayed at all times, tariff: 1,2,3, you can't change the tariff when the ride starts
	Tariff (Bottom right) - Button that changes the tariff to 1, 2 or 3
	Status - FREE or TAKEN
	Price - calculating the price while driving
	Start - Starts the ride with the tariff above and time. If the Taximeter is stopped (Payment Button) and Start button is clicked again the Taximeter continues to calculate 		the price.
	Payment - Stops the TaxiMeter calculator ( stops calculating the price)
	End - Ends the ride
	Last Ride Data - Probably a seperate "window", displays when did the ride start how long did it last when it ended, how much was it, distance?
